 framework, extends UNIX APIs, provides new kernel primitives
 
 Capsicum capabilities on FreeBSD and Linux hybridize a true capability-system model with the UNIX design and POSIX API.
 Capsicum capabilities are a refined form of file descriptor, a delegable right between processes and additional object types beyond classic POSIX, such as processes, can be referenced via capabilities. 
 In Capsicum capability mode, processes are unable to utilize global name spaces (such as the filesystem name space) to look up objects, and must instead inherit or be delegated them.
 
 add primitives to current application in OS to support capabilities
 
 cap_enter:     new system call, sets a credential flag.
                open in capability mode
                once set, cannot be removed.
                can be inherited
                restricted global OS namespace
                
 refine open flags on file descriptors
 
 ex. appilcation a:     read input
                        get rights to all files involved
                        cap_enter
                                work loop with defined capabilities
                 
                 gzip/ complex application:
                        cannot access all rights before work look execution begins
                        high level API- delegate rights/ manage files etc
                        
tcpdum-
refine existing file descriptors- take away rights that are not required.

apply capsicum on monolithic appilcation
apply capsicum to map distributed distributed security to local security policies
